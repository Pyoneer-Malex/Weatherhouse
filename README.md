# Weather-Station
The town where my university is located at haves some really unstable weather so I've created this simple yet useful project in order to monitor the weather and maybe find a pattern in order to predict it but I'll try to solve this later on. 

For now my project uses a arduino uno r3 as a microprossesor, a MH-RD to detect rain drop and a DHT-11 in order to measure the temperature and the humidity of the enviroment but I also bought a ESP8032 to connect it to WiFi so I can set up a webhook and have access to those data remotely (which I haven't beacuse of my exams). I also wanna buy a barometric pressure to find a better pattern but for now the project does the work.
