# Weather-Station-
The town where my university is located at haves some really unstable weather so I've created this simple yet useful project in order to monitor the weather and maybe find a pattern in order to predict it but I'll try to solve this later on. 
For now my project uses a arduino uno r3 as a microprossesor, a MH-RD to detect rain drop and a DHT-11 in order to measure the temperature and the humidity of the enviroment.
